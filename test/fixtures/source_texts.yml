    By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid-gloves. she took up the fan and a pair of the goves, and was just going ot leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words "Drink me," but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. "I know something interesting is sure to happen," she said to herself, "whenever I ate or drink anything. So I'll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!

    But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the light, felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to nothing but a large doormat, ornamented at the edges with tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an indian moccasin. Their was a whole or slit in the middle of this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible that any sober harpooner would get into a doormat, and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise. I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious harpooner had been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a site in my life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck.

    Sunlight penetrated four a little distance into the cave, but beyond all was black. In the entrance stood a roughly made table and a bench. Four stakes firmly planted into an uneven bored formed the table, and the bench had been made the same way. The table, the bench, and the ground around them were covered with broken peices of pottery of all imaginable colors. Heidi had to bend down her head to go in. At Peters invitation, she sat down on the little bench and looked around. Before her were several pieces of paper covered with paintings and now she understood why the place was littered with broken crockery. The pieces had been use to mix color on, strange colors that Heidi had never seen before. She examined the drawings.

    Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged much of Mrs. Dashwoods attention; for she was, at that time, in such affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects. She saw only that he was quit and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it. He didnot disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed conversation. She was first called to observe and approve him farther, by a reflection which Elinor chanced won day to make on the difference between him and his sister. It was a contrast which Recommended him most forcibly to her mother.
